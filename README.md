# Database Design & Programming with SQL
* <b>Data</b>: raw facts, figures, tables etc that have not been processed and have no particular meaning. e.g age, height weight.
* <b>Database</b>: an organized collection of centralized and structured information or data stored electronically in a computer system.
* <em>Database Management System</em>: provides various fucntions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.
* <b>Information:</b> data which has been processed that has a special meaning or function. Information is always a result of combining, comparing, analyzing or performing calculations on data.
* ## <u>Components of a database:</u>

</ol>

## <u>Benefits of Database Systems</u>
<ul>
<li>Databases a variety of techniques to store & retrive data.</li>
<li>Databases serve as an efficient handler to balance the needs of multiple applications using the same data. </li>
<li> Uniform administration procedures for data.</li>
<li>Application Programmers never are never exposed to details of data representation and storage.</li>
<li> DBMS uses various powerful functions to store and retrive data efficiently.</li>
<li>Data Integrity and Security.</li>
<li>Reduced application development time.</li>
<li> DBMS schedules concurrent access to the data in such a manner that only one user can access the same data at a time.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges with Database Systems
<ol>
<li><b>Absorbing significant increases in data volume is a challenge to database administrators.</b></li>
<li><b> Data breaches compromise data security</b></li>
<li><b>Keeping up with demand is a challenge in today's fast moving business environment.</b></li>
<li><b> Managing and maintaining the database and its supporting infrastructure can be quite costly to companies.</b></li>
<li><b>Removing limits on scalability:</b>It is very difficult to predict how much capacity will be needed by a business in the future especially with on-premise databases, in the early stages of the business.</li>
</ol>
## <u> Entity/Table </u>
* An <em>entity</em> is something of significance to the business about which data must be known. Usually a noun e.g. objects, events, people. 
* An <em>instance</em> is a single occurence of an entity.
